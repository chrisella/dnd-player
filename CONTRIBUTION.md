This project makes use of ESLint and Prettier to try and maintain a common code style.
The best IDE to work in is VS Code as this has ideal integration with these plugins and libraries.

# Tools

To get the best experience you should install the following extensions in VS Code:

- ESLint (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- Prettier (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

# Code Style

- Indentation should be commit using tabs (you can work with whatever format you like in your IDE).
